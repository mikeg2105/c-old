<P>

It is possible for the user to re-define few of the emperical parameters
used in the modelling

These are the constants in the k-epsilon turbulence model (CMU,C1 and C2)
and the <I> Effective </I> Prandtl number (Eprandl, Dprandl and Hprandl)used
for the turbulent transport of kinetic-energy, dissipation-rate and
enhtalpy respectively.
<BR> These equations are defined in the Fluent Manuals
Theory section.
