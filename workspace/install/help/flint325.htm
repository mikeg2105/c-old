<P>



   When a problem is defined, the default physical model used by Flint
   is that of <i> laminar flow </I> with no heat transfer.
   However, <B> SETUP -> DEFINE-PROBLEM </B> command will allow the user to
   switch on extra features to solve for. These features are:
   <UL>
   <LI>  Turbulant-Flow ( k-Epsilon model only)</li>
   <LI>  Heat-transfer calculations. </LI>
   <LI>  W-Velocities calculations(????)</LI>
   </UL>


   By default Flint solves the momentum and
   mass conservation equations in terms of u,v (and w for 3D ) velocity
   components and pressures (p).
   <P>
   Switching on the heat-transfer model introduces the energy
   conservation equation which is solved in terms of enthalpy values.
   <P>
   Switching on the turbulence model introduces two extra equations
   which are solved in terms of Turbulence Energy (E) and Turbulence
   Dissipation (D), by using the two-equation k-epsilon turbulance
   model.
   <P>
   These features will in turn have a direct bearing on the
   types of <A HREF="flint327.htm" >boundary conditions </A>that will
   need to be supplied. For example the walls will now need to have
   predefined temperatures or heat-flux values and turbulence quantities
   must be specified at the inlet boundaries.
