<P>
 In order to model problems where the inlet and exit pressures rather than the
 velocity values are known, pressure boundary conditions can be used.
 Examples include problems involving natural convection and problems where multiple
 exits to the domain exist and the division of flow between the outlets
 are determined by the pressure difference between them.
 Pressures are specified relative to the operating pressure and are
 in terms of Pascals. Turbulence Intensity can not be specified on pressure
 boundaries. Therefore even if the turbulence is switched on, user will not
 be asked to input turbulence values at the inlet boundaries.
 One way of overcoming this restriction will be to patch-in turbulence
 dissapation-rate and energy at the inlet cells, via the expert-patch menu.
