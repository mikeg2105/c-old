<P>
  This menu item contains all the graphical visualisation tools provided
  by Flint to display the results of the CFD calculations.

  It contains the following commands or sub menus;

  <UL>
  <LI> <A HREF="#OUTLINE">  OUTLINE </A></LI>
  <LI> <A HREF="#GRID"> GRID </A> </LI>
  <LI> <A HREF="#VECTORS"> VECTORS </A> </LI>
  <LI> <A HREF="#CONTOURS">CONTOURS </A> </LI>
  <LI> <A HREF="#CONTOURS">FILLED-CONTOURS </LI>
  <LI> <A HREF="#PROFILES">PROFILES </A></LI>
  <LI> <A HREF="#XYPLOTS">XYPLOTS </A></LI>
  <LI> <A HREF="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS </A></LI>
  </UL>
<HR>
<A NAME="OUTLINE" > </A>
  The OUTLINE command draws the geometrical outlines of the domain,
  which is definable as the wall/live_cells boundary. This command
  is available as soon as the computational grid is fully defined by
  means of the SETUP menu or by reading in a CASE file.
  <P>

<HR>
<A NAME="GRID" > </A>  GRID command draws the outlines of the computational grid by drawing
  the finite volume boundaries. This command is also available after
  the full definition of the computational grid.

  <P>
<HR>
<A NAME="VECTORS" > </A>
  VECTORS command displays the velocity vectors. There will be a single
  vector drawn for each computational(live) cell within the domain.
  These vectors will be colour coded according to the magnitude of the
  velocity. User is given the option to change the scaling or the colour
  coding of these vectors via the OPTIONS -> PARAMETERS menu.

 <P>
 <HR>
<A NAME="CONTOURS" > </A>
 CONTOURS and FILLED-CONTOURS menus work in the same way, drawing the
 equi-value contours for any selected field variable. The only
 difference between the two being that, in the case of filled-contours,
 the areas between the contours are filled with the appropriate colours.


 <P>
 <HR>
<A NAME="PROFILES" > </A>
 PROFILES are used for the graphical display of the variations of a selected
 variable along a particular line.
 The line along which the profile will be displayed can be selected to be
 one of the following types;

 <UL>
 <LI> Along I-Grid lines </LI>
 <LI> Along J-Grid lines </LI>
 <LI> Along the X-Axes </LI>
 <LI> Along the Y-axes </LI>
 <LI> Along arbitrary lines </LI>
 </UL>

 For the first four options, user will be invited to enter the
 number of profiles he requires, so that a series of profiles
 will be displayed along the specified direction.<BR>
 The case of arbitrary profiles work differently. Instead of
 being invited to enter the number of profiles required, the user
 will be invited to define a line 'by means of the mouse', along
 which the profiles will be displayed.<BR>
 This is one of the few instances of the need for the mouse-drag
 operation in Flint. User will be expected to define the arbitrary
 line by clicking the mouse button down at one end of the line
 and dragging the mouse while keeping the mouse button down.
 Flint will display the line while this operation takes place so
 that it can be located to users satisfaction. When satisfied
 user can define the final end of the line by releasing the button
 and the profiles are displayed immediately along this line.
 There is no limit to the number of profiles that can be
 drawn on the same graph by repeating the process above.
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="XYPLOTS" > </A>
XYPLOTS command can be used to draw XY plots of the selected set of
flow-field variables along a specified line. Inputs for this option
are by means of the keyboard rather than the mouse. That is to say
the space coordinates of the lines must be entered manually.<BR>
The procedure for plotting involves the following steps;
<UL>
<LI> Get-Data: This involves specifying a line and a list of variables
               which will be recorded over that line. </LI>
<LI> Chose-Data: Each set of variables picked-up by Get-Data is referred
                to as a TABLE. Chose data selects which table to use
                for the subsequent plotting operation. Tables are numbered
                from 1 onwards in the order of their creation.</LI>
<LI> Plot : Plot a selected list of variables from the currently chosen
            table. Variables are numbered according to the order of their
            selection during the GET-DATA stage above. Selecting more than
            one variable will allow plotting of multiple variables on the
            same plot.</LI>
<LI> Display-Table,Delete-Table,Write-Table,Options are auxiliary commands
     to help manage tables of data. </LI>
</UL>

<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="OPTIONS" > </A>
OPTIONS command controls a few of the graphics related parameters.
     <BR> These are:
     <UL>
     <LI> Rescale: This allows the user to attribute different scaling
          constants for X and Y directions, producing distortion effects.
          It may be of use when trying to view domains which may need to be
          expanded in one direction so as to be able to discriminate
          fine geometrical features.
          </LI>
     <LI> Mirror View: This allows a mirror view of a graph to be shown
          alongside the actual view.It may be of use for the visualisation
          of axi-symetric problems.
          </LI>
     <LI> Colour List: Allows the user to change some of the default colours
          such as the grid and outline colour.
          </LI>
     <LI> Parameters: Graphics related parameters which include;
           <UL>
             <LI> Vector Scaling factor: Exaggerate or reduce the arrow
                  sizes when plotting vector graphs.</LI>
             <LI> Draw Arrowheads: Controls drawing of vector heads. </LI>
             <LI> Profile Scaling Factor: Exaggerate or reduce the height of
                  the profiles when drawing profiles </LI>
             <LI> Fill Profiles: Draws solid colour profiles by
                  filling the area between the profile and the base of the profile
                    </LI>
             <LI> Set Profile range, Contour Range and Vector Scaling Range:
                  These are usually automatically selected by Flint to cover
                  all the values within the computational domain, but user may
                  define them manually to investigate finer variations around
                  a smaller range.
