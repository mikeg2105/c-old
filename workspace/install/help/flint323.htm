  The finite difference equations applied to a particular cell
  takes into account the influence of all its neighbouring cells
  as determined by the discretisation formulea.
  Therefore each finite difference equation will have terms contributed
  to it by each of its neighbouring cells.
  <P>
  In the case of wall/live-cell interface regions, the effects of the wall
  on the flow are modelled by using the wall function formulation
  (Spalding,1972 V303pp4-23), which introduces such effects as source terms
  by employing the log-law of the wall to compute the wall shear stress.
  By analogy between the heat and mass transfer equations the log-law of the wall
  is also extended to the wall heat-flux formulations.
  <BR> When link-cutting is applied to wall-boundaries this in effect makes
  the walls frictionless 'in the case of mass-transfer equations' and
  adiabatic 'in the case of heat-transfer equations'.

  <BR>
  Therefore the concept of link-cutting refers to the procedure whereby the
  discretisation equation for a particular live cell have no
  contributions made to it from any of the neighbouring boundary cells.
  This in effect isolates the cell from the adjacent boundary cells,
  allowing no flow of information from these cells. This is also
  regarded as a zero-gradient type boundary.<P>
  A good example of use of the link-cutting facility is for the
  modelling of free surface flows, as in the case of the surface of a
  vessel of fluid.
