  Flint/2D has been designed to be an almost entirely mouse-driven,
  easy to use, 2D CFD package for PC platforms.
<P> Flint is designed to be portable so that it can be ported to
various computing platforms.

<P> Whatever the platform, FLINT interface will always look the same and have
the following characteristics;

<P> Depending on what  is being perform, the user is presented with
 menus, tables , dialog boxes or with graphical representations
 of his geometry and/or fluid field values.

  For example, interactions to define the physical
   characteristics of a CFD model, such as the
 Density or the Viscosity of the fluid media are best performed
 by means of a <A HREF="flint122.htm"> keyboard interface </A>.
  Whereas tasks requiring definition or manipulation of the geometry
 or grid characteristics are performed via mouse actions by switching
 into the <A HREF="flint124.htm">Graphics Interface </A>.<BR>
 Therefore user will always be presented with the most suitable
 of one of the following two interfaces: <BR>
