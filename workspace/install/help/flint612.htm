<P>
 These features relate to the options which control modify or
 monitor the CFD calculations as carried out by the <A HREF="flint41.htm">
 SOLVE </A> command.
<P>

    These are;

    <UL>
    <LI> MONITOR-SOLVER: This switch enables the production of diagnostic
    reports for each of the equations being solved during each iteration.
    Normally only the sum of the residuals for each variable are printed.
    However, when this option is enabled the actual cell location of the
    largest residual value as well as the residual values themselves are
    reported.</LI>
    <LI> ALLOW PATCHING OF BOUNDARY VALUES: The EXPERT->PATCH command can
    be used to initialise or redefine the values of the field variables,
    such as velocities and temperatures, stored at the computational (live)
    grid locations. The boundary-cells will normally be protected from
    the actions of the PATCH command in order to protect the boundary
    conditions as defined earlier by the SETUP->BOUNDARY-CONDITIONS command. <BR>
    However, enabeling this option will remove such protection thus allowing
    the boundary conditions to be changed by means of the PATCH command.</LI>
    <LI> CONVERGENCE-DIVERGENCE CHECK ON: Iterations as initiated by SOLVE
    command will continue until a predefined convergence limit is satisfied.
    Once the convergence criteria is satisfied, Flint will not carry out
    any more iterations even if it is instructed to do so. <BR>
    Flint uses the convergence tests for also detecting signs of rapid
    divergence during the iterations in order to suspend a rapidly diverging
    process. Enabling this option will disable such checks so that the
    iterations will be carried out without any  attention to divergence/
    convergence.
    </LI>
    <LI> SET MINIMUM RESIDUAL SUM SUM: The convergence criteria used by Flint
    is to check the sum of the normalised sum of residuals, as reported
    during each iteration, against a predefined limit, which is 1.0E-3
    by default. This option allows the user to redefine the convergence
    limit used for this criteria.</LI>
    <LI> NORMALISE RESIDUALS: During SOLVE, normalised values of the residual
    sums are reported at each iteration step. Disabling this option reports the
    actual, rather than the normalised values.</LI>
    <li> CONTINUITY CHECK: There is a built-in mass continuity check, which
    aborts the iterative solution if any mass-imbalance is detected.That is
    to say, the total mass entering the domain must equal the mass exiting the
    domain. If there are any OUTLET cells Flint will usually ensure this
    mass-balance by using these cells.This option can be used to disable
    the mass continuity checks.</LI>
    <LI> ENABLE QUADRATIC UPWIND SCHEME: By default Flint uses a power law
    to interpolate the values of the field variables between the grid
    points. An alternative method of interpolating these field variables
    is the (QUICK) quadratic upwind differencing scheme, which can sometimes
    produce better results by reducing the artificially induced numerical
    diffusions.</LI>
    <LI> RESET OPTION: If this option is enabled than every time the user
    goes into SETUP menu, it will be assumed that there will be some major
    changes carried out to the geometry, grid or boundary conditions which
    will warrant resetting all the field variables to zero so as to ensure
    that there is no spurious information left over from any previous calculations.
    </LI>
    <LI> SET PRESSURE REFERENCE LOCATION: Pressures are usually treated as
    relative values and a cell is normally selected by Flint to be the
    reference cell, while carrying out he calculations.
    It is recommended that a live-cell is used for such purpose.</LI>
