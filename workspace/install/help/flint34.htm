<P>

 Having defined the geometry and grid, the only remaining task
 relating to the geometrical specifications of a FLUENT CFD problem
 will be to define the types of cells which make up the geometry.
 <P>
 This task is the same as FLUENT, SET-CELLS task but it is performed
 entirely  via a Graphical Interface.
  While the geometry and grid is been defined, Flint anticipates the
 cell types by setting all the outer cells to be of type WALL
 and all the interior cells to be of type LIVE.
  So, when SET-CELLS is entered for the first time, the user will be
  presented with this default configuration.

 <P>
 Two new icons, named TYPE and ZONE are introduced to assist with the task
 of setting Cell-Types.
 <P>
 Different colours are associated with different CELL-TYPES and live(.)
 cells are always displayed as empty ( Black) cells. <BR>
 Currently, as well as LIVE cells the following cell types can also be
 set;

 <UL>
 <LI> WALL,</LI>
 <LI> INLET,</LI>
 <LI> OUTLET,</LI>
 <LI> SYMETRY,</LI>
 <LI> CYCLIC,</LI>
 </UL>

 Some cell types such as WALL and INLET always have ZONE numbers associated with
 them. When a cell or group of cells are made WALL or INLET cells,
 they take on the currently defined ZONE number as shown by the ZONE icon.
  The current ZONE number can be changed by simply clicking on the ZONE
  icon. A click with the left-mouse-button increments the ZONE number
  by one, whereas clicking the ZONE icon with the right-hand mouse button
  decrements it by one. Zone numbers run from 1 to 9 followed by A to Z.

<P>
   During set-cells operation, clicking on a cell with the left-hand mouse
   button simply sets that cell to the currently selected cell-type
   as being displayed by the TYPE icon. If the cell-type is such that
   it requires a zone-number than it takes on the currently selected
   zone-number as displayed by the ZONE icon.
<P>
   Clicking on a cell with the RIGHT-HAND mouse button sets that cell
   to type LIVE.
<P>
   Setting of a cell's type is confirmed by the new colour it assumes.
   The zone number associated with the cells may also be displayed in text
   if there is sufficient space to do so. Set-cells operation looks
   very much like a simple paint-in-the-boxes game where the currently
   selected pen colour is changed and displayed via the TYPE icon.
<P>
   Setting cells one-by-one can become extremely tedious,if not
   impossible for large grids. It is therefore much better to set
   a block of cells by means of a mouse-drag operation.
   This is one of the few rare places in FLINT where a mouse-drag
   is needed.  To set a block of cells, press the mouse button on
   a cell,keep the button down and slowly move the mouse over the
   cells you wish to set while still keeping the mouse button down.
   <BR>
   The block of cells which will be effected by this action gets
   highlighted while the mouse is being moved. Releasing the
    mouse button at any stage sets all the currently highlighted
    cells to the current type (and zone).

<P>
    When dealing with large grids, it helps to make full use of the
    ZOOM IN/OUT, ZOOM IN and PAN graphical view icons during the
    set-cells operation.
