<P>

The menu structure of FLINT reflects the steps that are needed to define
and solve a CFD problem, which can be summarised in the following
cronological order:

<OL>
<LI> Define the Pysical Geometry:<B>SETUP</B> </LI>
<LI> Define the Computational Grid:<B>SETUP-->GRID</B> </LI>
<LI> Define the Boundary Conditions:<B>SETUP-->BOUNDARY</B> </LI>
<LI> Define Physical Properties of the media:<B>SETUP-->PHYSICAL-CONSTANTS</B> </LI>
<LI> Solve the problem:<B>SOLVE</B> </LI>
<LI> Display the results:<B>VIEW</B> </LI>
</OL>

There are also the usual menu items relating to file operations
for saving the geometry, grid and results on the computer so that they
can be restored back into Flint or read into other packages later.
These are all collected together under the heading of <B>FILE </B> main menu.
<P>
Finally all the advanced features of Flint relating to the problem definition
or solver related features are presented together by means of the <B>EXPERT</B> menu.
<P>
To make life easier, only the menu items that can be
utilised meaningfully at a particular time are presented to the user.
For example, when FLINT is first entered, the initial menu looks as follows:
<BR>
<IMG SRC="MENU3.GIF" >
<BR>
This will allow user to either read in a file saved during
a previous FLINT session or SETUP a new problem or simply QUIT.
<BR> However once a file is read or a problem is setup, other menu items
for solving the problem and displaying the results become visible as
shown below; <BR>

Another user friendly feature of Flint is the ease with which user can
step back to alter, say the geometry, grid or boundary information
without having to start all over again!
