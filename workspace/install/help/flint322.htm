<P>
 Modelling of turbulent flows are attempted by means of the
 (reynolds) time averaged continuity equation, where the velocity
 values represent only the time averaged values and the turbulence effects are
 introduced into the flow equations as "Reynolds stresses".
 Flint relates the Reynolds Stresses to the mean flow qualities via the
 k-epsilon model. This is the only turbulence model that is allowed
 in Flint.
 <P>
  Explain E and D ?????
