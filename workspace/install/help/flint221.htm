<H3> IMPORTANT CONCEPTS </H3>


In Flint terminology the complete geometry is made up of one or more
connected four-sided <A HREF="flgdefi.htm#REGION" > regions </A> .
All regions will have four edges and four
corners. A region can share any or all-four of its <A HREF="flgdefi.htm#EDGE">
edges</A> with other
neighbouring regions. However, a single edge can only be shared by no more
than two regions. In fact Flint geometry is always analogous to a fish-net
where each hole in the net defines a region. The shape of these holes
(regions) can be distorted by stretching, shrinking or distorting each
of the four sides providing the logical connectivity of the fishnet topology
is kept intact.
<P>

 At first glance, this seems to impose strict constraints on the types of
 geometry which can be generated but in practice this is not the case and
 any intricate geometry can be generated by reducing
 the mesh size.
  As we shall see later, any disadvantages of having to build the geometry
  by four sided regions is far outweighed by the almost trivial way of
  in which grids can be generated for these geometries.
