<P>

 Having defined the grid distribution along all the edges by means of the
 <A HREF="flint26.htm" > Define-Grid command </A>, any of the
 <A HREF="flgdefi.htm#GRDCNTL" >   Grid-Control-Points </A> position
 can be changed individually by this command.
 <P>
 While in Refine-Grid view, user can select any grid-control-point by clicking
 the mouse on or near one. The selected point latches onto the mouse
 and hence can be re-positioned by moving the mouse and clicking it once more
 to re-position it. As usual, the right-hand-button can be used for precise
 positioning via dialog boxes.
 <P>
 If a wrong grid-control-point is selected by accident, the situation can be
 retrieved by pressing the ESC button or clicking the mouse outside the
 main display area.
 <P>
 It is also important to note that the grid-control-points form an ordered
 set of points from which the internal grids are generated later.
  In order to ensure  the validity of the internal  gridding, ordering of
  these grid control points  must never be changed. I.e. Do not re-position
  a grid-contol-point anywhere except somewhere between its neighbours.
  Such attempts will usually be signalled and not allowed by Flint's
  internal checks.

<P>

  Only one new icon named <B> INSERT CPOINT </B> is introduced to assist with
  Grid-Refinement. This icon allows the user to add an extra
  Grid-Control-Point where it is needed. This is equivalent to inserting
  an extra line of cells in a Fluent geometry.
  <P>
  Clicking on this icon changes the function of the mouse for the next task
  only. Flint sounds a bleep and also prompts the user to click the mouse
  where s/he intends to insert a grid-control-point. When the user clicks
  the mouse in between two grid-control-points Flint inserts the new control
  point at that position and returns to the usual state of allowing the user
  to select and move grid-control-points.<BR>
  While trying to insert a control-point if the user does not click between
  two grid-control points then the operations is cancelled and everything
  is returned to normal state. <BR>
  It is important to note that, inserting an extra grid-control-point on one
  edge will automatically insert one extra control point at the corresponding
  position of all the edges which are logically accross from it. This ensures
  the grid-validity.
