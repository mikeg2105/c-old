  <P>
    More advanced features relating to the boundary conditions can be
    specified by means of the <B> SETUP -> BOUNDARY-OPTIONS </B> command.
    These are
    <UL>
    <LI> <A HREF="flint323.htm" >Link settings: </a> Enabling this option
    allows finer control over the interactions between the boundary nodes and
    their adjacent live-cells. For most problems default built-in links will be
    sufficient. </LI>
    <LI> <A HREF="flint322.htm"> Inlet turbulence quantities:</A> This enables the user to specify the values
    for the kinetic energy and dissapation rate of turbulence at the inlet
    boundaries. If this option is not enabled then the inlet turbulence
    intensity, together with a length-scale drived from the size of the inlet
    will be used to determine the inlet values of kinetic energy and
    dissipation. </LI>
    <LI> Flux boundary conditions: When the heat transfer calculations
    are switched on, this option will allow the user to specify the
    boundary conditions in terms of heat-flux in Watts per meter square.
    Adiabatic walls can be simulated by setting the heat-flux to zero.</LI>
    <LI>  External heat transfer walls: This option enables the specification
    of the wall boundary conditions in terms of the external heat transfer
    coefficient and the temperature of the external heat sink ( or source )</LI>
    <LI> <A HREF="flint321.htm"> Allow fixed pressure boundaries:</a> This option allows the user to
    specify at the inlet boundaries the total pressure, instead
    of the velocities. Pressure boundary conditions should be used in situations
    where there is more than one exit from the domain.</LI>
