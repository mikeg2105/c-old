<P>


  Whilst in CREATE-REGIONS mode, clicking the mouse within the main graphics
  area latches onto the nearest <B> eligible </B> <A HREF="flgdefi.htm#CORNER" >corner </A>
  that can be used for creating the
  first <A HREF="flgdefi.htm#EDGE" >edge </A> of a new region. As a corner can be shared by at most
  four regions, only the corners with less than four connected edges are
  <B> eligible </B> at this stage. The other "free" end point of the edge is latched
  onto the mouse,  allowing it to be placed at a suitable location by clicking
  the mouse button again. At this stage, precise positioning can be
  achieved by clicking the right mouse button instead of the left button.
  <P>
  Once the first edge is defined in this fashion,  user is either invited
  to select the first "existing" end-point of the second edge '<I> providing there
  are more than one eligible points for creating the new region</I>' or the
  mouse is automatically latched onto the only eligible corner,
   allowing user to define the
  second edge. Once the two new edges are defined + the already existing
  edge, the new region becomes fully defined. and the process can be repeated
  if necessary to define new regions.
 <P>
  At this stage of creating new regions
  there is no need to locate the corners precisely as this can easily be done
  later by means of the <A HREF="flint243.htm"> MOVE POINT </A> actions. Note also that Flint does not
  allow the creation of extremely distorted, badly concave or geometrically
  invalid regions by performing a series of tests on the new region.
  However, such tests are not performed during MOVE-POINT actions,
  thus allowing users to distort regions  at the risk of creating invalid,
  hence un-gridable, regions.The relaxation of the rules are allowed here
  because of the fact that it will be easy  to
  visualise the validity of an existing  region whilst moving one of
  its corners.
  <P>
  When a new region is created, Flint also checks if the formation of the
  new region have resulted in the complete definition of any of the
  neighbouring regions. If that is the case those regions are also
  automatically created.
