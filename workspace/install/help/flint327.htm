<P>



   <P>
    Once the type of problem which is being tackled is defined by means
    of the <A HREF="flint325.htm"> Define-Problem </A>( and optionally
    <A HREF="flint320.htm"> Boundary-Options </A>) command, actual
    boundary conditions can then be set by using the BOUNDARY-CONDITIONS
    graphical user interface.
   <P>
    The BOUNDARY-CONDITIONS interface looks exactly like the
    <A HREF="flint34.htm"> Set-Cells </A>
    interface except that clicking on a cell does not change its cell-type
    but sets the boundary conditions for all the cells of that type and
    zone number.<P>
    It is at the boundary-conditions stage that the zone numbers associated
    with the bondary cells comes into effect. Setting the boundary conditions
    for a single cell automatically set the same bondary conditions for all the
    cells of same type and zone number.<P>
    For example, to set the boundary conditions for INLET-1 cells simply
    click-on one of the INLET-1 cells.<BR>
    This will pop-up a table allowing
    the user to enter the boundary conditions which will be applied to all cells
    of type=INLET and zone=1.
    <BR>
     These will generally be the <B> U-Velocity,V-Velocity </B> values and
    optionally <B> Turbulence Intensity </B> and <B>Temperature </B>values if turbulence and
    heat-transfer models had been activated via the <A HREF="flint325.htm" >
    Define-Problem </A> command.
    <P>
    If the fixed pressure boundaries option is enabled via the
    <A HREF="flint320.htm" > Boundary-Options </A> command, then the user
    will be requested to enter the pressures, rather than the
    velocity values.<BR>
