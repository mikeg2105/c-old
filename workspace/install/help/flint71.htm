<P>

All the file input/output related features of Flint are contained
within the FILE main menu. These are;


<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#RC">  READ-CASE </A>   </LI>
<LI> <A HREF="#WC"> WRITE-CASE </A>  </LI>
<LI> <A HREF="#WG"> WRITE-GRID </A>  </LI>
<LI> <A HREF="#RD"> READ-DATA </A>   </LI>
<LI> <A HREF="#WD">WRITE-DATA </A>   </LI>
<LI> <A HREF="#DOS">DOS-SHELL </A>   </LI>
<LI> <A HREF="#QUIT">QUIT     </A>   </LI>
</UL>

<HR>
<A NAME="RC" > </A>
READ-CASE command reads Geometry, Grid, Cell and Boundary information
which had been stored into a file by means of the 'WRITE-CASE' command
during a previous Flint session. These case files are stored
unformatted in a computer dependent way. Therefore they can not be read or
manipulated by any other means except 'Flint'.
<P>
By default all case files are stored using the <B>.CAS</B> filename extension,
so that they can be easily identified. File read menu normally displays
only the filenames with the .CAS extension as well as any subdirectories
and also the parent directory as <B>..</B>. This will enable the Flint user
to change directories and search through them by simply clicking on them.<BR>
As well as all the files matching the search pattern, which is <I> *.CAS </I>
by default and the local directories, there are also the following three entries
on the user selection list these are;
<UL>
<LI> QUIT: Quit file read operation to return to Flint menus. </LI>
<LI> CHANGE-DRIVE: Search other hard,network or floppy drives. </LI>
<LI> WILD-SELECT: Change the default file search pattern (from *.CAS ). </LI>
</UL>

<HR>
<A NAME="WC" > </A>
WRITE-CASE command will save all the current Geometry, Grid, Cell and Boundary
information into a file. The user will normally be offered a default name which
can be modified by the user. The default name will always have the .CAS filename
extension. It is strongly recommended that this extension is used for all saved
case files.

<HR>
<A NAME="WG" > </A>
WRITE-GRID command will save the current Grid and Cell information as a
Formatted PREBFC file. These files can later be read into all versions higher
then V4.11 of Fluent. It is also possible to convert these 2D grids into
3D by using Fluents 3D-from-2D command. Restricted versions of Flint/2D
have this facility disabled.

<HR>
<A NAME="RD" > </A>
READ-DATA command reads all the field information
which had been stored into a file by means of the 'WRITE-DATA' command
during a previous Flint session. These data files are written unformatted
and therefore can not be read or manipulated by any other means except 'Flint'.
<P>
By default all data files are stored using the <B>.DAT</B> filename extension,
so that they can be easily identified. File read menu normally displays
only the filenames with the .DAT extension as well as any subdirectories
and also the parent directory as <B>..</B>. This will enable the Flint user
to change directories and search through them by simply clicking on them.<BR>
As well as all the files matching the search pattern, which is <I> *.DAT </I>
by default and the local directories, there are also the following three entries
on the user selection list these are;
<UL>
<LI> QUIT: Quit file read operation to return to Flint menus. </LI>
<LI> CHANGE-DRIVE: Search other hard,network or floppy drives. </LI>
<LI> WILD-SELECT: Change the default file search pattern (from *.DAT ). </LI>
</UL>
<HR>
<A NAME="WD" > </A>

WRITE-DATA command will save the current solution information i.e. the complete
set of field variables for all the grid-locations into an unformatted data file.
The default filename extension is  .DAT. It is strongly recommended that this
extension is used for all saved data files.

<HR>
<A NAME="DOS" > </A>
DOS-SHELL command starts up a command shell in which DOS commands can be executed.
This is only useful for the DOS version of FLINT where multi-tasking is not possible.
User can return back to FLINT by typing EXIT in this command window.


<HR>
<A NAME="QUIT" > </A>
QUIT command simply terminates a FLINT session. It is important to save
your geometry, grid and field data information by using the WRITE-CASE and
WRITE-DATA commands if you have made any modifications and you wish to refer
to them during future Flint sessions.
