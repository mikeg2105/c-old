<P>

 Having defined the geometric features of a model by means of
 <B>Define-Geometry</B> "and optionally by <B>Refine Geometry</B>" the next stage
 of dividing this domain into a set of suitably sized, well-structured four-sided
 computational cells is achieved by the use of Define-Grid command.
 The Define-Grid task is presented by means of a
  <A HREF="flint124.htm"> graphical interface</A>.

<BR>
 <BR>
 The following two icons are introduced to assist the user ;
  <UL>
  <LI>  <A HREF="#DEFGRD">  DEFAULT-GRID</A> </LI>
  <LI>  <A HREF="#GRDIST"> GRID-DISTRIB. </A> </LI>
 </UL>

 When in Define-Grid view, only the edges of the regions and their edge-control
 points (X) are displayed. The object being to define the numbers of cells we
 wish to distribute along each edge. We do not, however, have  the complete
  freedom
 to distribute arbitrary numbers of cells along each individual edge.
 This is because, for each domain, edges which are logically across from
 each other will be forced to have the same numbers of cells distributed along
 them.  This condition ensures that the structural integrity
 of the complete grid can not be violated as well as making the task of
 grid-definition almost trivially easy!
 <P>
 All edges which have not yet been grided  are displayed in RED.<BR>
 The edges which are already grided are displayed in GREEN along with
 the small blue crosses (+) which mark the exact distribution of the
 grid lines along that edge.<BR>
 These markers are known as the
 <A HREF="flgdefi.htm#GRDCNTL" >   Grid-Control-Points </A>.
 They are usually equally spaced from each other but the spacing scheme
 can easily be altered by the use of the  <A HREF="#GRDIST"> GRID-DISTRIB.</A>
 icon. They can also be individually manipulated later  during the
   <A HREF="flint27.htm"> Refine-Grid</A> stage. <BR>
<P>
  To grid an edge, user simply clicks the mouse near its edge-control point.
  User is then prompted for the number of cells s/he wish to distribute
  along that edge. Where, s/he may either accept the default offered by
  clicking the mouse button again or enter a different number and
  press ENTER. <BR>
  I.e.:  Double-clicking the mouse will simply grid that edge with
  the currently defined default number of grid-control-points.
  Griding one edge will automatically grid all the other edges which are
  logically across from it in the same manner and with the same numbers
  of cells.<BR>
  There are no restrictions as to the chronological order of the gridding
  operations and already grided edges can always be re-gridded 'say with a
   different number of cells'.



<P>


 <A NAME="DEFGRD" > </A>
 <HR>
 <CENTER> <B> DEFAULT GRID </B> </CENTER> <br>

  During Define-Grid, when the user tries to grid an edge which has not
  yet been gridded  'and hence displayed in red' he is offered the default
  number of cells along that edge. Initially this is set to 6 but can be
  changed by the use of the DEFAULT-GRID icon. <BR>
  When re-gridding of already gridded edges are attempted, the default
  offered will be the currently defined number of grids along that edge
  and not the current default as set by the Default-Grid Icon. <BR>



 <A NAME="GRDIST" > </A>
 <HR>
 <CENTER><B> GRID-DISTRIBUTION </B></CENTER> <br>
   By default, grid points along each edge are distributed equally spaced
  from each other. However, this can be changed by the use of the
  <B> Grid-Distrib. </B> icon. <BR>
  When clicked on, this icon presents the user with a menu of three choices
  which are;

  <UL>
  <LI>  UNIFRM: Equally spaced grid points, </LI>
  <LI>  SKEWED: Distance between grid points increasing or decreasing, </A> </LI>
  <LI>  BELL:   Distance between grid points are increasing then decreasing
                or visa-versa. </LI>

 </UL>

  Selecting SKEWED or BELL distribution leads to further dialog tables
  to define the expansion factors etc.
  An expansion factor of 1.0 implies a uniform grid.
  An expansion factor of<I> <B> n </B></I> where n is a real number implies
  that the distance between the last two grid-points is <I> n </I> times the
  distance between the first two grid points.


 <P>
  IMPORTANT NOTE: Selecting a particular grid-distribution-type does not
  effect the already gridded edges. The grid-distibution type  only
  applies to the newly gridded or re-gridded edges following the selection.
