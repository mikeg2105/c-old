<P>


The number of iterations required before a solution is achieved will inevitably
depend on the number of cells in the domain and the number of equations being
tackled ( i.e. the physical complexity of the model). <BR>
There are, however, other factors which may contribute to the speed of
convergence ( or the cause of divergence ).
It is not uncommon to find combinations of geometries, boundary conditions and
physical properties which will cause rapid divergence.
Some problems will also need to be coaxed into a path towards convergence
by setting the field variables to reasonable initial values, switching off
some of the physical complexity or reducing the relaxation factors.
<P>
Following is a list of techniques to improve convergence;
<OL>
<LI> Start with a reasonable set of initial conditions.
      PATCH-DATA command can be used to set the values of field variables
      for a selected group of cells. In the absence of an initial guess,
      Flint sets all the variables  to zero for all the live cells.
      Note that the temperature is set to 0C  ( i.e. 273K ).
      Patching is recommended for the fluid temperature for problems involving
      heat transfer. If a large number of computational cells are used it
      will be an advantage to start with reasonably guessed velocity fields.</LI>
<LI> Solve partial problem initially and add physical complexities one at a time
     later.<BR>
     In problems involving complex physical models and large amounts of
     equations, it will be a great advantage to solve the problem a step at a
     time, eventually introducing the complete physical model.
     For example, in flows involving heat and fluid transfer, it will
     be useful to start off with an isothermal flow by patching the velocity
     field to initial guess values but not solving for enthalpy. After a
     reasonable flow field is established (for example - residuals have gone
     down to around 1.0E-2 ) you can start solving for heat transfer.
     The ability to select and re-select which equations to solve is
     achieved very easily by means of  EXPERT   ->   SELECT-VARIABLES menu.

      Switching off the equations involving a particular variable freezes
      the value of that variable and its current distribution until it is
      switched back on again. These techniques are particularly useful when
      studying reacting flows, where species concentrations and temperatures
      can be established before chemical reaction equations are enabled.
      It is important to note that  you must finally be able to achieve
      convergence with all the equations switched on.
      It is also important to note that if the properties of your fluid vary
      with temperature it will not be advisable to switch the enthalpy equation
      off permanently.</LI>
<LI>  If possible start from a previous solution. This is a similar message to
      the one given in (2) above but it refers to changes in the  physical
      geometry. However there are strict conditions attached to its being
      usable. If you have already found a converged solution for a problem
      and you like to solve a similar problem on a slightly different geometry
      then you can:
      (a) modify the case file to change your geometry and save
          it as a new case file
      (b) read the data file containing the solution for the original
          geometry to speed up convergence.
          For example, when you are trying to find the best position of
          internal baffles this method will save a lot of time. It is only
          usable if the number of cells in all the directions ( and hence
          the total number of cells) remain unaltered from one geometry to
          the next.
       </LI>
<LI>      Reduce Underrelaxation Factors. During each iteration, having calculated a new value for a particular variable, Fluent replaces it with a corrected value by using the formula;
	      ALPHAnew  =   ALPHAold +  (ALPHAnew-ALPHAold)<br>

          where; ALPHA is known as the under-relaxation factor which will normally
          vary between 0.0 and 1.0.  ALPHA= 0.0 implies no change ( which is
          pointless !). ALPHA=1.0 implies we use the new values without taking
          the old values into consideration.<BR>
          When you start Fluent calculations ( i.e. SOLVE ) during the
          initial few iterations you are likely to notice oscillations in the
          reported normalised residuals. This is because during the initial
          stages, there are likely to be rapid changes in the values of the
          variables from one iteration to the next. However, such oscillations
          should start to die down as the calculations proceed. It is sometimes
          possible for the oscillations not to settle but to actually cause
          divergence. This will be reported by the message  RAPID DIVERGENCE
          DETECTED and the calculations will abort.<br>
          There may be a number of causes for divergence, including ill- formed
          boundary conditions, physical constants etc., distorted grids, large
          body-forces, steep variations in the fluid properties and so on.<BR>
          It is also possible that a solution may exist for a difficult
          physical model, as long as can we get past the initial stages of
          iterations on the way towards a solution. This can be achieved by
          reducing the underrelaxation constants to start with, waiting for
          the residuals to settle and increase these constants back to
          improve convergence. Menu EXPERT - UNDERRELAX-1 will allow the user
          to redefine these constants for each variable.
          </LI>

<LI>  Change direction of the sweeps of solver if necessary.
Flint uses iterative methods to obtain an approximate solution to the
discretised equations. This technique is referred to as the Line-Gauss-Seidel
method, which involves simultaneously solving the linearised equations for a
group of cells at a time rather than for the whole domain. As these equations
are themselves only approximate linearisations of the actual governing equations,
it will be unnecessary and inefficient to attempt a complete solution.<BR>
Grouping is done for numerical convenience so that a line of cells
( of fixed I direction , or fixed J direction ) falls into the same group.
Default being fixed I direction. In Flint terminology Fixed I direction
implies Sweep Direction=2 and fixed J direction implies Sweep Direction=1 .<BR>
It is advisable to  select a sweep direction as perpendicular to the
predominant fluid flow as possible. So, if the expected flow is predominantly
in X direction select Sweep Direction=1.
<BR> This option can be controled by means of the
<B> EXPERT   -> SWEEPS-OF-SOLVER </B> menu. <BR>

Considerations about the sweeps of solver are needed only if the
convergence is very slow.
<BR>Flint also includes options to solve
the pressure equations bu what is known as
MULTI-BLOCK techniques to avoid problems of slow convergence due to the
slow propagation of variables across the whole geometry, particularly with
problems containing large numbers of cells. In multi-block mode, solution
involves super-cells, which are simply much larger cells made up of
the original cells. <B> EXPERT -> PRESSURE-SOLVER </B> command controls
the use of Multi-Grid Pressure-Solver and its parameters.

<LI>  Monitor Solver to find out the trouble spots.
</OL>
The usual residual reports which are displayed after each iteration give
an adequate indication of how the solution is progressing generally.
However, in cases when the convergence is becoming harder to achieve,
it is possible to get an indication of the trouble spots by enabling
the MONITOR-SOLVER option in the EXPERT  -  SOLUTION-PARAMETERS  table.
This will give a single line report on where the largest residual was
found during which equation. When using MULTI-BLOCK methods of solution
there will be extra monitor information displayed to indicate the progress
of the solution during each refinement. In the MULTI-GRID-SOLVER-PARAMETERS
menu MONITOR-MG-SOLVER option can be used to control this monitoring information.
