  Any unwanted region can be removed by selecting the DELETE REGION icon
  and clicking inside the region which needs to be deleted and confirming
  deletion by a second click of the mouse. Flint tries not to allow
  complete seperation of the domain by prohibiting the deletion of the internal
  regions, i.e. any region with all four existing neighbours.
  Such unwanted regions will not be of any problem later as they can be
  set to WALL ZONES.
