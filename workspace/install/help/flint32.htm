<P>
  Flint provides a number of menus for entering and modifying
  the physical aspects of a CFD problem and the boundary conditions
  which apply to them.
   These are:
   <UL>
   <LI> <A HREF="flint325.htm" >SETUP -> DEFINE PROBLEM </a></LI>
   <LI> <A HREF="flint326.htm" >SETUP -> PHYSICAL CONSTANTS </A> </LI>
   <LI> <A HREF="flint320.htm" >SETUP -> BOUNDARY-OPTIONS </A> </li>
   <li> <A HREF="flint327.htm" > SETUP -> BOUNDARY-CONDITIONS </A></LI>
   </ul>

   While these options give users some flexibility in modelling
the physical aspects of a CFD problem, as Flint is primarily designed
for teaching, an expert CFD engineer will soon find it rather limited
in the scope of problems Flint can tackle.<BR>
 <B> FILE -> SAVE-GRID </B> command will cater for such eventuality
 allowing the user to save his Flint generated computational-grids
 into a <B> <I>grid-file </I></B>
<BR>
   These Grid-Files can later be read into Fluent and used for tackling
  more complex CFD problems by means of the <I> SETUP - READ-GRID </I>
  command within Fluent.
