Flint produces a report of residuals for each equation
once per complete iteration. These residuals provide a
measure of how well each governing equation is satisfied
averaged over all the cells in the computational domain.
<P>
 Consider a single (live) cell (P), which is surrounded
 by 4 cells E,W,N and S, corresponding to East,West, North
 and South neighbours.
 After local linearisation and discretization, the conservation
equation for any field variable can be expressed in the following
general format;
<P>
<B> ApTp = Ae*Te + Aw*Tw + An*Tn + As*Ts + S </B>
<P>
<B> Where; Ap = Ae + Aw + An + As + S </B>

<P> <B> T </B> stands for any one of the field variables u-velocity,
v-velocity,turbulence energy, turbulence dissipation and enthralpy
<BR> <B> S </B> stands for the source (or sink) terms which represents the
creation (or destruction) of the field variable within the cell(P).
<BR> Ae,Aw,An and As are the finite difference coefficients which
represent the combined effects of convection and diffusion through the
volume of cell P.
<P>
 During the first iteration residuals reported corresponds to the imbalance
 in the above equation summed over the complete computational domain.
 That is ; <P>

 Residual <B> R = summed over all cells( Ae*Te + Aw*Tw + An*Tn + As*Ts + S -
 ApTp) </B>
<P>
After the first iteration Flint reports residuals in a normalised form
by simply dividing <B> R </B> by <B> SUM </B>
<BR> where; <B>  SUM= summed over all cells ( ApTp ) </B>
<P>
That is to say, the residuals are normalised by dividing the imbalance
by the coefficient of the left hand side of the finite difference equation.

<P>
Reporting of the residuals for pressure values are slightly different
to other field variables. What is reported as pressure residuals are infact
the mass-imbalance driven from the mass continuity equation, which simply
states that what goes in must come out.
