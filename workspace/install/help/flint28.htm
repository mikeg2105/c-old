<P>

 Having defined the grid-control-points by means of the Define-Grid and
 optionally Refine-Grid commands, Flint goes ahead and automatically generates
 all the internal grid points by using interpolation techniques.

 <P>
 There is normally no need to adjust these internal grid points, but
 if the user wishes to do so, Manipulate-Grid command allows users
 to re-position each individual internal grid point.<BR>
 One use of this feature is to define internal geometrical features
 which had not been defined during the Define-Geometry and
 Refine-Geometry phase.
 During the Manipulate-Grid phase, all the Guide-Curves which had been created
 during Refine-Geometry are shown. Although it is not possible to lock
 internal-grid-points onto guide-curves, never-the-less these curves can be
 used as simple visual guides while re-positioning grid points.<BR>
 For example, to create a circular object within the interior of a region,
 one can define a guide-circle of required dimensions and position
 while in Refine-Geometry and use this circle as a visual guide while
 adjusting the internal grid points.

<P>

  Only one new icon named <B> ADJUST </B> is introduced to assist with
  the Manipulate-Grid task. This icon allows the user to define how
  moving one internal grid point will effect its neighbours.
  By default, ADJUST OFF is in effect and moving an internal grid point
  has no effect on its neighbours. It is therefore important that illegal
  grids are not created by moving the grid points excessively such that
  the grid lines start crossing each other.<BR>

<P>
  As usual,  moving a grid-point is done by clicking the mouse on or near
  it moving it to a new position and clicking the mouse button again.
  As usual, right-hand button allows for precise positioning of the grid point.
  ESC key can be used to cancel the current action. Attempts to move a
  grid-point outside the main graphics area will also act as a cancel request.


<P>
  By clicking on the <B>adjust </B> icon user can select how moving one
  grid point may effect its neighbours. When the adjust icon is displaying
  OFF, changing the position of one grid point will have no effect on the
  positions of its immediate neighbours. At the other extreme, when the
  adjust AUTO is selected moving a grid point in one particular direction
  will stretch the entire grid towards that direction while keeping all
  WALL-type cells and domain boundary cells firmly anchored.
  <BR>
  The inability to manipulate the positions of the WALL-TYPE cells can be
  put to good use by setting all cells that should be left intact during
  Manipulate-Grid to WALL type by means of the <A HREF="flint34.htm">
  SET-CELLS </A> command.
  <BR> Between the two extremes of ADJUST OFF and ADJUST AUTO lies the
  ADJUST LIMITED state, whereby user defines at most how many layers of
  neighbouring cells will be effected by a move.
