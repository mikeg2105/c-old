<CENTER> <H3> SOLVING THE PROBLEM</H3> </CENTER>
<P>

Having defined the geometry, grid and the boundary
conditions, starting up the iterative procedure for
the solution of the flow field which meets the given boundary
conditions is achieved by means of the <B> Solve </B> main menu
option.
<P>
The governing equations are almost invariably non-linear and inter-dependent
to each other. As such systems of equations present no directly attainable
analytical solution an iterative solution approach will have to be adopted.
Computationally, this involves <A HREF="flint412.htm"> linearising all the
governing equations at each cell location </A> and simultaneously solving them to calculate the
values of the field variables. Using the scheme outlined below, these
recently calculated field values are then re-used while re-linearising the
equations and the process is repeated until strong signs of convergence are
detected.
<P>

<B> Solve </B> command requires only one input, that is the number of
iterations to perform.<BR>
There is no need to carry out large numbers of iterations from the onset.
It is advisable that, to start with, only a few iterations are
performed to make sure that the solutions are progressing satisfactorily.
Flint will always remember the field values calculated so far. Therefore
iterations can be continued later on during that session.<BR> Alternatively
the <B> File->Save-Data </B> command can be used to save the field values
calculated so far into a file which can be read back into Flint during
a later session.
<P>
The number of iterations needed to achieve complete convergence depends
on how well-defined the problem is as well as the geometry, the number of
computational cells and the number of equations being solved,
which reflects the physical complexity of the problem.


<P>
<B> SCHEME OF SOLUTION </B>
<P>

Iterations involve the following steps:

<OL>
<LI> Velocity components <B> u,v,w </B> and fluid momentum equations are solved using the guessed
      values of the pressure field  <B> p </B> </LI>
<LI> Using the newly calculated <B> u,v,w </B> the mass balance equation is solved
     to obtain the new values of the pressure field <B> p </B> </LI>
<LI> For turbulent flows turbulence equations are solved using the other flow variables</LI>
<LI> Depending on the type of problem being tackled, other field equations
      are solved , e.g. enthalpy, radiation etc.</LI>
<LI> Fluid properties e.g. density, viscosity
     (they may depend on the temperatures) are recalculated </LI>
<LI> Residuals are calculated and  checked against the convergence limits </LI>
<LI> If the convergence limits have not been met, the process is repeated
     from step (1) for another iteration.
</OL>


<P>
The total number of iterations needed to achieve a satisfactory
solution of a particular problem can never be predicted with
any great accuracy. This number is usually linearly related to the
total number of live cells in the domain, The physical and geometrical
complexities of the domain has a major influence in the numbers of
iterations needed. These compexities can even cause divergence during
the particularly early stages of the solution. Badly defined or unrealistic
boundary conditions is another reasons for divergence.
Finally, what makes a satisfactory solution 'satisfactory', i.e. the
convergence limits, will obviously effect the number of iterations needed.
<P>
Once the solution starts, user can monitor the progress of the iterative
solution by observing the relative-residuals report which produces one
line of output per iteration, indicating the normalised residuals of
all the variables in the solution. For simple flows involving no
heat transfer and turbulence U,V (and W if required) velocities
and the Pressure (P)are used for the reporting of the residual values.
For turbulent flows the kinetic energy of turbulence
(E) and the dissipation rate (D) are also included in the report.
For flows involving heat transfer there will also be an entry indicating
the Enthalpy values (H).
<P>
 Apart from during the first iteration, all reported values are
 normalised. For example a reported residual value of 1.0E-2 for
 v-velocity indicates that the change of  values from previous
 iteration to this one has been about 1.0 percent of the actual v-values.
 values.

 <P> This brings into focus the definition of a satisfactory solution
 in terms of the residuals. The question of when to terminate
 a steadily converging iterative process and declare the results
 satisfactory is not always easily answerable.<BR>
 The pit-falls of very slow convergence due to the nature of the
 problem or due to the factors effecting the iteration process or
 even convergence to a false solution due mainly to the initial conditions
 can occur. Refer to <A HREF="flint411.htm">the section on tips for
 a satisfactory solution</A> for more information.

 <P>
 Flint normally performs all the number of iterations requested by
 the user before accepting any further instructions. However, if a
 satisfactory convergence is detected the calculations will be
 halted automatically without having to carry out the requested
 numbers of iterations.<BR>
 We recommend that, initialy, only a few iterations are carried out
 and the residual reports are observed to see if the iterations are
 progressing satisfactorily and there is no appearent divergence
 taking place. Depending on the nature of the problem, oscilations
 of the reported residual values, particularly during the early
 stages, may be observed. These should however die out as the
 iterations progress and the reported residuals show steadily
 decreasing values.
 <P>
 <A HREF="flint411.htm"> Remedial actions </a>will be needed in cases
 of detection of unsatisfactory convergence or un-damped oscilations
 of the residual values.

 <P>
 The default conditions for such an automatically halting of the
 calculations and declaring convergence is the point
 when the total sum of the reported residuals of all the reported
 variables dips below 1.0E-3.
 This convergence criteria along with other factors effecting
 the solution can be changed via the EXPERT->SOLUTION-PARAMETERS
 option.
