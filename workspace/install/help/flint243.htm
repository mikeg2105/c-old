  During Define-Geometry, the MOVE-POINTS icon can be selected to switch
  into this mode.


  Whilst in Move-Point mode , user is given
 the freedom to latch onto and move any one of the corners of the regions.

  To move a  corner, simply click the mouse button
 on or near that corner.  This operation will latch that corner
  onto the mouse. Move the corner to where you would like it to
   be by moving the mouse and click the mouse button again.

  Note that LEFT-BUTTON click will always position the control-point
   immediately where
 it appears to be where as RIGHT-BUTTON will ask the position to be confirmed,
 in terms of its (X,Y) coordinates thus allowing for exact positioning.  <BR>
 When a corner is being moved, new outline of the regions sharing that
 corner point are constantly updated,
  giving user an acurate view of the effects of his
 actions before they are confirmed and made permenant by clicking the mouse.
 Also, at this stage, the move operation can be cancelled to revert the
 control point to its previous location by pressing the ESC key or by
 clicking the mouse button outside the main graphics area.
