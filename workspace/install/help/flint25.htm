<P>

 This is the second stage of the geometry definition, achieved by means of a
  <A HREF="flint124.htm"> graphical interface</A>.

<BR>
  Having already defined regions in  <A HREF="flint24.htm" > DEFINE-GEOMETRY </A>,
 the user is given the freedom to manipulate the actual shapes of these regions
 and their edges. If during this stage it becomes appearent that more regions
 are needed or some of the existing regions needs to be deleted, it is always
 possible to drop back into DEFINE-GEOMETRY
 without affecting the current features.
 <BR>
 The following three icons are introduced to assist with refine geometry;
  <UL>
  <LI>  <A HREF="#MOVE">  MOVE-POINT</A> </LI>
  <LI>  <A HREF="#EDGET"> EDGE-TYPE </A> </LI>
  <LI>  <A HREF="#GUIDEC"> GUIDE-CURVES</A> </LI>
 </UL>

 When the geometry is displayed all corner-points of the regions are marked
 with green rectangles. In addition every edge have a single red
 cross (X) associated with it. These red crosses are used in controlling
 the shapes of the edges and hence refered to as
 <A HREF="flgdefi.htm#EDGECNTL" >   Edge-Control-Points </A>.


 <A NAME="MOVE" > </A>
 <HR>
 <CENTER> <B> MOVE-POINT </B> </CENTER> <br>
 Whilst in MOVE-POINT mode ,<I> which is the default mode, </I> user is given
 the freedom to latch onto and move any one of these green-rectangle or
 red-cross points.
 For example, to move an edge-control-point, click the mouse button
 on or near that point.  This operation will
 latch that control-point onto the mouse. Move the control-point to where
 you would like it to be by moving the mouse and click the mouse button again.
  Note that
 LEFT-BUTTON click will always position the control-point immediately where
 it appears to be where as RIGHT-BUTTON will ask the position to be confirmed,
 in terms of its (X,Y) coordinates thus allowing for exact positioning.  <BR>
 When a control-point is being moved, new shape of the edges which are
 effected by that control point are constantly displayed,
  giving user an acurate view of the effects of his
 actions before they are confirmed and made permenant by clicking the mouse.
 Also, at this stage, the move operation can be cancelled to revert the
 control point to its previous location by pressing the ESC key or by
 pressing the mouse button outside the main graphics area.


 <A NAME="EDGET" > </A>
 <HR>
 <CENTER><B> EDGE-TYPE </B></CENTER> <br>

 Experimentation with moving the corner points or
  the edge-control-point of a new edge will quickly
 reveal that the edges look like spline-curves. In fact the default edge type
 is a 3-point spline going through the two corner points+the one edge control
 point. Each end-point gradient being set to the gradient of a line joining the
 adjacent control points. This is only one of
 <A HREF="flgdefi.htm#EDGETYPE" >  five different types of edges </A>
 that can be used.
  The type of an edge can be changed very easily by means of the
  EDGE-TYPE icon, by clicking on this icon and selecting
 a new edge type from the pop-up menu.
 Once an edge-type is selected, it becomes the current-edge-type and
 moving any edge by its edge-control-point ( red X ) automatically
 makes that edge assume the current-edge-type. The current-edge-type
 is always displayed on the EDGE-TYPE icon in red text.

 <A NAME="GUIDEC" > </A>

 <center> <B> GUIDE-CURVES </B> </center>

   The concept of guide curves give Flint the ability to generate finely
 detailed edges and shapes. The guide curves are free standing geometrical
 curves which can be generated independently of other Flint structures.
 However, what makes them special is the fact that having generated a guide
 curve, an edge can later be made to follow it  ( or part of it )
 precisely, hence the name.

  Currently there are three types of guide-curves; CIRCLES , PARABOLAS
  and SPLINES.<BR>
   Splines can be formed by using from 4-points upto 19-points. This gives
  enough flexibility to generate any arbitrary shape.<br>
   Once formed, a guide curve can be moved and/or re-shaped by moving
    its individual control points. However, see below for restrictions.

 <P>

 <center> <B> LOCKING ONTO GUIDE-CURVES </B> </center>

  If not for the ability of being able to lock edges onto
  the guide curves, they would have no real purpose.
  To lock an edge onto a guide curve, first move the two corner-points of the
  edge onto the guide curve and finally move the the edge control point (X)
  onto the guide curve. Success of the locking operation is signalled
  by making the edge follow the guide curve precisely and also a musical
  note. The locking of an edge is achieved by checking the proximity of all
  three points of an edge to the guide-curve, it is therefore important
  to make sure that all three points are on or very near the guide-curve.
   <BR>
  Once <B> locked </B> onto a guide curve, an edge can be <B> unlocked </B>
  by moving its control point away from the guide-curve. This is signalled
  by a (reverse) musical tone.
  <BR>
  <B> IMPORTANT NOTE: </B> Once an edge gets locked onto a guide curve,
  the guide curve becomes fixed and impossible to move. So if you wish to
  move or re-shape a guide curve, you must first unlock any edges which
  are locked onto it. Also note that, there is no limit to how many
  edges can be locked onto a single guide-curve.
