<P>

 This is the first and the most important stage of the geometry definition
 in terms of connected four-sided<A HREF="flgdefi.htm#REGION" >
  regions </A>.<BR>
 During the Define-Geometry <A HREF="flint124.htm"> graphical interface</A>,
  users  can;
 <UL>

 <LI> <A HREF="flint241.htm" > CREATE-REGIONS</A>,</LI>
 <LI> <A HREF="flint242.htm" >DELETE-REGIONS </A>,</LI> or
 <LI> <A HREF="flint243.htm" >MOVE-POINTS</A>(to re-position the corners of the regions) </li>
 </UL>

  On entry to this graphical-panel, user will be put into the CREATE-REGIONS
 mode. Changing to DELETE-REGIONS or MOVE-POINT mode can be achieved by
 simply clicking onto the relevantly named action icon on the right hand
  side of the window.<BR>
 Also the [FILE] icon on the right hand-side, which exists in every Graphics
 Panel, can be used to exit out of DEFINE-GEOMETRY and/or go straight onto the
 next stage which is to <A HREF="flint25.htm"> REFINE GEOMETRY </A>
  or <A HREF="flint26.htm"> DEFINE GRID</A> .
  <P>
  A discerning user will have noticed that, during Define-Geometry
  all edges appear to be confined to straight lines.
  However, this is not the case and as we shall see next in
  <A HREF="flint25.htm"> REFINE GEOMETRY </A>
  curved and almost any arbitrarily shaped edges can be generated.
  As a matter of fact, what is displayed during the stage of DEFINE-GEOMETRY
  is a logical view of all the regions where all edges are presented
  by straight lines connecting the corners or the regions.
  Default shape of a newly defined edge is a 3-point spline which
  approximates to a straight line.
