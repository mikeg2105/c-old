<P>
Given the complex, non-linear and inter-dependent nature of the field
equations the best that can be achieved is to linearise the field equations
for each of the field variables at each grid location by assuming that the
other variables remain constant and independent of that variable.
<BR>
  For each of the field variables, this will yield a set of <I><B> n </B> </I> linear equations that can be
tackled numerically, where <I><B> n </B> </I> is the number of discreet grid
locations.
<P>
During each iteration, Flint solves these sets of linearised field equations
by iterative means.
 Although they can be solved by direct methods,
this is computationally more costly and also unnecessary. More costly, because
the direct solution of these sets of equations will involve the inversion of a
sparce, but not necessarily banded,very large coefficients matrix. Unnecessary,
because, these equations represent only a locally linearised problem,
where the term 'locally' is used to imply the fact that the current values of the
other field variables are assumed to remain unchanging during the solution. This is
so that the coefficients of the linear equations can be numerically calculated.
Therefore it is pointless to aim for an accurate solution of these
equations while the accuracy is already compromised by assuming that the other
field variables remain static.
<P>

Let us define <B> &Oslash;</B> to be a field variable. <BR>
Having decided on an iterative approach such as the Gauss-Seidel method, the
solution progresses by calculating the new values of <B> &Oslash;</B> from
the current values of all the field variables as; <P>

<B> &Oslash;(calculated) = function(all field variables including &Oslash;(previous)&nbsp;)</B><BR>
<B> &Oslash;(new) = &Oslash;(calculated)</B><P>

 We therefore replace the previous values of <B> &Oslash;</B> with the newly
 calculated values of <B>&Oslash </B> and repeat the process.<BR>
 This is normally performed by cycling through all
 the field variables during each iteration and the process continues until
 the differences between &Oslash;(new) and &Oslash;(previous) fall below acceptable
 limits.
 <P>
 In practice, the above formulea does not yield the fastest possible convergence
 and in some cases it may even cause divergence.<BR>
 A better formulation will be as follow;
 <P>
<B> &Oslash;(calculated) = function(all field variables including &Oslash;(previous)&nbsp;)</B><BR>
<B> &Oslash;(new)  = &Oslash;(previous)&nbsp;+&nbsp;alpha*(&Oslash;(calculated)
                  - &Oslash;(previous)&nbsp;)</B>

<P>

 Where <B>alpha</B> is known as the underrelaxation,overrelaxation or
 accelaration factor.<BR>
  When  <B>alpha=1.0</B> the equation reduces to the previous form, where
  &Oslash;(new) is equal to &Oslash;(calculated) <BR>
  When  <B>alpha=0.0</B>  &Oslash;(new) remains the same as  &Oslash;(previous),
  which is of course pointless as the solution never progress.<BR>
  When <B> alpha </B> is between 0.0 and 1.0  &Oslash;(new) takes a value
  between  &Oslash;(calculated) and  &Oslash;(previous). This is the case of
  underrelaxation which represents a damping effect being applied.<BR>
  When  <B> alpha </B> is greater than 1.0 the effect is that of acceleration
  or overrelaxation as the new values of the field variables are projected
  beyond the calculated values.

 <BR>
   <BR>

 In iterative systems pertaining to CFD studies it is usually the case that
 values of alpha slightly less than 1.0 yield optimal convergence by damping
 down the solution to avoid diverging oscilations. There is however no hard
 and fast rules for an optimal value of alpha. By default Flint uses different
 underrelaxation factors for different field variables, reflecting the
 nature of the equations. These default values are usually, but not always, good
 enough to achieve a steadily converging solution. <BR>
  This menu option will allow the user to experiment with the underrelaxation
  values to achieve or improve convergence.
  <P>
The only general rule wich can be stated regarding the underrelaxation factors
is that, at the early stages of iterations lower values of the underrelaxation
factors will help avoid divergence but as the iterations get closer to the
converged state, increasing the underrelaxation factors can help speed up the
progress.
 <P>
  The following table gives the default values of the underrelaxation values
  for each of the field variables; <BR><BR>
