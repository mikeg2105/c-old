 <H3> GLOSSARY OF FLINT GEOMETRY TERMS </H3>

<HR>
<A NAME="REGION" > </A>
<b> REGION: </B> <br>
The complete flint/2D geometry is made up of connected, four-sided regions
"quadrilaterals".
A region will always have four corner-points and four edges, which connect
these four corner points to form a quadrilateral.

<HR>
<A NAME="CORNER" > </A>
<b> CORNER: </B> <br>
The complete flint/2D geometry is made up of connected, four-sided regions
"quadrilaterals" with four corners. There can be maximum of four edges
connected to each corner.


<HR>
<A NAME="EDGE" > </A>
<b> EDGE: </B> <br>
 Each flint/2D region is enclosed by four edges. An edge is a curve which
 connects the neighbouring corners of a region.


<A NAME="EDGETYPE" > </A>


<HR>
<b> EDGE-TYPE: </B> <BR>
<A NAME="EDGECNTL" > </A>
Each edge  have an associated edge-type which determines the type of curve
which defines that edge. Currently the following edge types are allowed:

<OL>
<LI> A Straight line</LI>
<LI> Two connected lines </LI>
<LI> A 3-point spline </LI>
<LI>  A parabola </LI>
<LI> A circular arc </LI>
</OL>

An edge can also be locked onto a guide-curve, in which case it stops
having an associated  curve-type and follows the guide-curve.

<HR>
<B> EDGE-CONTROL-POINT:</B> <BR>
Apart from the two corner points, every edge in flint-geometry has an
intermediate point known as the edge-control-point. The position of this
point is displayed only during the Refine-Geometry stage by a red X.
<BR> It is used as the third control point of the curve which
defines the shape of that edge.<BR>
 This is why the edge-types shown in the table above are chosen carefully
 to be only those types of curves which can be fully definable by at most
  three points, i.e. two corner points and one edge-control point.
<BR>
 This, what appears to be the restriction to five edge-types can easily
 be overcome by means of  GUIDE-CURVES, which allow edges to follow
 any user-defined curve with many control points.

<P>

<A NAME="GRDCNTL" > </A>
<HR>
<B> GRID-CONTROL-POINTS:</B> <BR>

 Grid generation in FLINT is performed by;
  <UL>
  <LI>  For each region, define the grid distribution along each edge. </LI>
  <LI>  Using these points, known as the Grid-Control-Points, griding of the
        interior regions are done automatically. </LI>
  </UL>
