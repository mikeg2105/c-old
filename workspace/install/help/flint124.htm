<CENTER> <H3> FLINT: GRAPHICAL INTERFACE </H3> </CENTER>

<H3> GRAPHICS ARES: </H3>
Flint graphical interface screen is divided into following
three areas:

<UL>
<LI><b> MAIN AREA:</b> Where the actual geometrical or field
values are shown. It is the largest part of the screen and is
normally sensitive to mouse-click events to allow user to interact
with the components of his model, such as selecting/moving/deleting.
</LI>
<LI><b> ICONS AREA:</b> This is located at the right hand side of the FLINT
 graphics screens displaying sets of icons to allow user to select
 an action to perform by clicking on the icons, such as MOVE a point,
 CREATE a Guide Curve or to simply change the viewing properties
 by zooming panning etc. </LI>

<LI><b> MESSAGE AREA:</b> This is located at the bottom few lines of the
screen, where helpful messages to prompt user on what to do next
or WARNING messages to notify user of the limitations of the program
are displayed. There will normally be no need to perform mouse-click
operations on this area.
</LI>

</UL>

<H3> MOUSE ACTIONS: </H3>

 <UL>
 <LI><B> Clicking:</B> By far the most common mouse interaction with FLINT is
      the mouse-click operation. Selecting of edges,control points regions etc.
      are achieved by clicking on or near them.
      Except in a very few cases (see dragging below) , user will be expected
      to click the mouse button and<B> release it immediately</B> without dragging it.
      <UL>
      <LI>When clicking on the MAIN area to position control points etc., clicking
      on the right mouse button gives user full control of the exact location
      of the control point by inviting the user to enter the exact x and y
      coordinates. Where as left mouse click simply accepts the coordinates from
      where the mouse is pointing to.</LI>
      <LI> When clicking on ICONS,  left or the right button can be
      used interchangably and has the same effect.
      Exception to this rule are the<I> CELL-TYPE</I> and the<I> ZONE-NUMBER</I>
      icons in the<B> SETUP, SET-CELLS</B> window.  Each mouse click on these two
      icons selects a new CELL-TYPE and ZONE-NUMBER respectively.
      Left mouse button selects the next cell type ( or zone) where as
      the Right mouse button selects the previous one on the list.</LI>
      </UL>
      </LI>

 <LI><b>Moving:</b> In Geometry-Setup screens, when re-positioning grid
  control points edge control points etc.  mouse pointer should always be moved
    without holding a mouse button down, i.e. it should not be dragged!  </LI>
    During geometry setup tasks,after an item such as an edge control point is
    selected (by clicking), the mouse pointer disappears and the selected item
    latches onto the mouse, making moving of objects intuative.
    If a mistake has been made and a wrong point selected pressing ESC
    or clicking outside the Main-Area will de-select the item and return
    it to previous position.

 <LI><b> Dragging</b>(i.e. moving button while holding a mouse button down):<BR>
      Only in following situations mouse dragging is needed:
      <UL>
      <LI> In VIEW-GRAPHICS, PROFILES when selecting random profile lines.</LI>
      <LI> In VIEW-GRAPHICS generally PAN can be achieved by dragging using
           the LEFT mouse button and ZOOM is achieved by dragging with the
           RIGHT mouse button  </LI>
      <LI> In SETUP, SET-CELLS click,hold button down and drag to set a block
           of cells to the currently selected cell-type.Also in this context
           block of cells can be turned into <B>live cells </B>by using the right
           mouse button in stead of the left one.</LI>
