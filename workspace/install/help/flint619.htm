<P>

As the pressure-correction equation is one of the hardest equations to
solve, Flint has built-in options to treat it specially and tackle it by
using what is known as 'Multigrid' techniques.By default Flint uses the
built-in <A href='flint618.htm'> LGS Solver<A>. LGS solver works well in
effectively propogating error corrections between the neighbouring lines
of cells. However this may not be as effective and desirable when the
error correction needs to be propogated rapidly down the domain. This is
particularly the case in problems involving very large numbers of cells.
<P>
What is needed is a mechanism for a rapid progression of the information
beyond the immediate lines of cells. This is implemented by means of
the Multigrid mechanism. This involves automatic successive corsening of
the original grid into a number of coarser grid levels. Or in other words
the original finite-volumes are combined together in a systematic manner
to form larger super-volumes and the transport equations are solved for
these super-volumes. The results are then transfered back to the original
volumes level, thus enabling the faster propogation of information while
still retaining the local error propogation features.
<P>
In multi-grid terminology the process of coarsening of the grid is known
as creating a new grid level. The original grid being level-1.
In Multi-grid terminology every level contains super-cells each of which
is made up of 3*2=6 cells of the previous level.
Maximum number of Multi-Grid levels is set at 6 but can be redefined by
the user.
<P>
A strategy for moving between levels is adopted so that when the rate of
reduction of the residuals at a particular grid-level falls below
a predefined ratio then the calculations are performed on a coarser grid.
Another rule states that if the calculations appear to be sufficiently
converged at a level then the calculations are performed on a finer grid
during the next iteration. These two factors are known as the residual
reduction parameter and the termination criteria respectively and can
be altered by the user.
The block correction option accelerates the convergence by calculating
global corrections which drive the solution towards a solution by applying
global conservation conditions.
