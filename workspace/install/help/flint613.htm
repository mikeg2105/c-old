<P>
 Normally, at each iteration step, Flint will solve the governing
 equations pertaining to all the relevant field variables. For example, in
 problems involving heat transfer, the enthralpy equation is solved
 at each iteration. If, on the other hand, the problem does not involve
 any heat transfer calculations, there will be no need to solve this
 equation and the residuals will simply be reported to be 0.0.
 <P>
 There is normally no need to specify which equations needs to
 be solved here as Flint deduces such information from the
 problem and boundary-condition definitions. <BR>
 However, in types of problems where the convergence is becoming
 difficult to achieve, a judicious use of this menu can help achieve
 convergence. It is possible that the effects of the highly coupled
 governing equations, combined with the values of the field variables
 which are still too from the solution, will result in badly
 defined linearised equations, thus causing divergence.
 In such situations, it may be advisable to remove some of the coupling
 manually by keeping certain variable(s) fixed while solving for the
 remainder of the variables. Once the near convergence with a limited
 set of variables are achieved, the previously fixed variables can be
 brought back into play by using this options menu, or even by alternately
 selecting a new set of variables.
<P>
 The following are the list of field variables which can be selected
