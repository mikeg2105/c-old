 Before proceeding further please refer to the
  <A HREF="flint221.htm"> Important Concepts of Flint Geometry here  </A>.

<P>
 Complete geometry and grid definition normally takes place
 by the following sequence of steps. However, Flint is inteligent
 enough to allow skipping some of the steps and jumping backward and
 forwards to change the geometry or grid features later on.
 Any step which is not possible to take yet does not appear
 in the Geometry-Setup menu, making it easy to navigate.
