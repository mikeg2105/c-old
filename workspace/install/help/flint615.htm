<P>
 When a geometric domain and the type of problem which will be solved over
 that domain is defined and the boundary conditions are specified, all that
 remains is to start the calculations off from some initial values of the
 field variables for all the cells which make up the computational domain
 and solve the discreetised governing field equations until a satisfactory
 convergence is attained. <P>
 As the solution is iterative, the initial values of the field variables have
 a very strong bearing on the speed and even the convergence of the solution.<BR>
 For example, it is possible that a set of conditions corresponding to a
 perfectly feasible solution may display divergence when the initial
 values are too far away from the final solutions.</P>
 <P>
 Unless PATCH'ed by the user Flint assumes the initial values of all the
 field variables to be 0.0, except temperatures which are set to 273Kelvin
 'i.e. 0 Centigrate'.
 <P>

 By using this option user
 can set the values of the field variables to initially guessed values so as
 to speed up convergence.
