<UL>
<LI> User is presented with a menu across the top of the page, from where
a menu-item is selected by either CLICKING the mouse on the required
item or high-lighting an item by using the cursor keys or by typing
the first-letter of the menu-item and pressing ENTER.</LI>
<LI> Further "POP-UP" menus or TABLES or DIALOG-BOXES
 may appear as a result of this selection.</LI>
<LI> Tables are lists of logically related options with YES/NO answers
or NUMERIC fields each of which have an explanation to its right.
Selection of a table item is achieved either by clicking  the mouse
in the appropriate field or by using the cursor keys, which changes the
focus of input and highlights the selected field. The current value of the
highlighted field can be changed by simply typing in a new value.
User can exit a table via either the DONE or QUIT icon which appears
at the bottom of each table.
<BR>
  Exiting a table via the QUIT icon returns
all table entries to their previous values before the table was entered.
</LI>

<LI> Dialog boxes are just like single table entries which ask a question,
supplying the default answer, and invite user to enter a new value or to
simply accept the default value by pressing ENTER or CLICKING the mouse
outside the dialog box.
<BR>
The YES/NO questions will only accept YES,Y , NO or N as answer which can
also be toggled by the use of the cursor keys.</LI>

<LI> Finally the ESC key is universally available to undo the very last
graphics or text action and to exit tables/menus etc by discarding the
changes.
ESC can be considered as a KEY to press when in trouble!
